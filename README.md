# GetInterestTest

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI. It includes the following files and folders.

- get-interest - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- get-interest/tests - Unit tests for the application code. 
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions and an API Gateway API. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project.

## Deploy the application

The Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run the functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate the application's build environment and API.

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* Node.js - [Install Node.js 10](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the NPM package management tool.
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

To build and deploy the application for the first time, run the following in the shell:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

The first command will build the source of the application. The second command will package and deploy the application to AWS, with a series of prompts:

* **Stack Name**: The name of the stack to deploy to CloudFormation. This should be unique to the account and region, and a good starting point would be something matching the project name.
* **AWS Region**: The AWS region you want to deploy the app to.
* **Confirm changes before deploy**: If set to yes, any change sets will be shown to you before execution for manual review. If set to no, the AWS SAM CLI will automatically deploy application changes.
* **Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation**: Many AWS SAM templates, including this example, create AWS IAM roles required for the AWS Lambda function(s) included to access AWS services. By default, these are scoped down to minimum required permissions. To deploy an AWS CloudFormation stack which creates or modified IAM roles, the `CAPABILITY_IAM` value for `capabilities` must be provided. If permission isn't provided through this prompt, to deploy this example you must explicitly pass `--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM` to the `sam deploy` command.
* **Save arguments to samconfig.toml**: If set to yes, the choices will be saved to a configuration file inside the project, so that in the future you can just re-run `sam deploy` without parameters to deploy changes to the application.

You can find the API Gateway Endpoint URL in the output values displayed after deployment.

NB: in order to run via AWS API Gateway, at present the input parameters need to be defined by hand:
* balance (decimal)
* currency (e.g. Â£)

## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build the application with the `sam build` command.

```bash
GetInterestTest$ sam build
```

The SAM CLI installs dependencies defined in `get-interest/package.json`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.


## Unit tests

Tests are defined in the `get-interest/tests` folder in this project. Use NPM to install the [Mocha test framework](https://mochajs.org/) and run unit tests.

```bash
GetInterestTest$ cd get-interest
get-interest$ npm install
get-interest$ npm run test
```

NB: the tests need to be updated to pass in parameters and check outputs for a number of target test points:

balance		interest rate	interest
0.01		1				0
1			1				0.01
999.99		1				10
1000		1.5				15
1001		1.5				15.02
4999.99		1.5				75
5000		2				100
9999.99		2				200
10000		2.5				250
49999.99	2.5				1250
50000		3				1500

Also, the parameter 'queryStringParameters' is not understood when run locally & causes error.

## Cleanup

To delete the application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used the project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name GetInterestTest
```
